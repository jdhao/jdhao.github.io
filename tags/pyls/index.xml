&lt;p>In my &lt;a href="https://jdhao.github.io/2020/11/04/replace_deoplete_jedi_for_LSP/">older post&lt;/a>, I have shared how to set up
auto-completion for vim-lsp with the help of deoplete. One annoyance is that I
can not use fuzzy matching for auto-completion: the completion items in the
pop-up completion menu seems to be selected base on prefix matching.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flake8 Config in Pyls for Code Linting.</title><link>https://jdhao.github.io/2020/11/05/pyls_flake8_setup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2020 00:27:36 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://jdhao.github.io/2020/11/05/pyls_flake8_setup/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;font color="red">Update 2021-07-15: Note that pyls has been deprecated.

&lt;p>In my &lt;a href="https://jdhao.github.io/2020/11/04/replace_deoplete_jedi_for_LSP/">previous post&lt;/a>, I have go over the basic setup to make vim-lsp work.
However, I haven&amp;rsquo;t touch on an important part of writing code: linting. It
turns out that configure it correctly is harder than I thought.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replace Deoplete-jedi with LSP Finally</title><link>https://jdhao.github.io/2020/11/04/replace_deoplete_jedi_for_LSP/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 00:10:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://jdhao.github.io/2020/11/04/replace_deoplete_jedi_for_LSP/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;font color="red">Update 2021-07-15: Note that pyls has been deprecated.

&lt;p>After using deoplete along with deoplete-jedi for more than two years, I have
finally decided to try something new for code completion. Yeah, you guess it,
the &lt;a href="https://langserver.org/">Language Server Protocol&lt;/a> (LSP in short).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
