My colleagues gave me
some photographs taken with a smartphone. On their machines (Windows 7), all
the photos were shown correctly in landscape mode. However, when I checked
those photos, I found that some of those photos were shown in portrait mode
(rotated 90 or 270 degrees) or upside-down (rotated 180 degrees).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was curious what happened and learned about
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif" target="_blank">Exif&lt;/a> and all its related stuff.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
