I talked about how to automate the server login process with the help of Expect
programming language. This post continues my learning process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Server Autologin with Expect</title><link>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/10/08/server_autologin_with_expect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 23:01:24 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/10/08/server_autologin_with_expect/</guid><description>&lt;p>I use a Windows 10 machine and need to connect to Linux servers. After using
several &lt;a href="https://www.slant.co/topics/149/~best-ssh-clients-for-windows">ssh clients&lt;/a>
for connecting to the server, I finally settled for
&lt;a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mintty/wsltty">Wsltty&lt;/a>, which is open-sourced and use the
well-known &lt;a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty">mintty terminal&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But one feature I miss from the SSH tools such as MobaXterm or Xshell is that
these tools can save the server IP, port, user name and even password, so that
you can log into the server with just a click.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With mintty terminal, I have to manually ssh to my server each time, which is
tedious and time consuming. Fortunately, I have found the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect">Expect&lt;/a> scripting language which is
pretty powerful for this task.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
