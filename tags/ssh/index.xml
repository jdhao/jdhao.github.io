except the fact that I can use &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; command to log into my remote servers.
Recently, I found myself some time to learn how does it work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Execellent Development Experience with Cygwin and Mintty Terminal on Windows 10</title><link>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/10/23/cygwin_install_and_use/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 15:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/10/23/cygwin_install_and_use/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Linux is great for programming compared to Windows. If you miss the experience
you get on Linux, maybe you should try &lt;a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt;, which
set up a Linux-like environment on Windows platform. In this post, I want to
talk about how to configure Cygwin and how to use mintty terminal on Windows 10
to get excellent programming experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Server Autologin with Expect</title><link>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/10/08/server_autologin_with_expect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 23:01:24 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/10/08/server_autologin_with_expect/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I use a Windows 10 machine and need to connect to Linux servers. After using
several &lt;a href="https://www.slant.co/topics/149/~best-ssh-clients-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ssh clients&lt;/a&gt;
for connecting to the server, I finally settled for
&lt;a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mintty/wsltty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Wsltty&lt;/a&gt;, which is open-sourced and use the
well-known &lt;a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;mintty terminal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one feature I miss from the SSH tools such as MobaXterm or Xshell is that
these tools can save the server IP, port, user name and even password, so that
you can log into the server with just a click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With mintty terminal, I have to manually ssh to my server each time, which is
tedious and time consuming. Fortunately, I have found the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Expect&lt;/a&gt; scripting language which is
pretty powerful for this task.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to Use Putty on Windows</title><link>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/04/12/putty-windows-x11-forwarding-setup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 00:20:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/04/12/putty-windows-x11-forwarding-setup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Putty&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful and
slim ssh tool with rich features. It is widely used to connect to the remote
servers. I will summarize some of its settings and usages in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Set up X11 Forwarding with Git for Windows (git-bash)</title><link>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/03/02/windows-connect-server-x11-with-gitbash/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 00:05:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://jdhao.github.io/2018/03/02/windows-connect-server-x11-with-gitbash/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jdhao.github.io/2017/12/29/cmder-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;As I have posted earlier&lt;/a&gt;,
Cmder is a better option if you use Windows command line frequently. The full
installation of Cmder comes with &lt;a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Git for Windows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is handy to provide a Linux-like
environment. In this post, I will write about how to use Git for Windows to
connect to a remote CentOS server and set up X11 forwarding to use the GUI
applications on that server.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
