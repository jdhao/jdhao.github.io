managers to install a package to its default location (usually under &lt;code>/usr&lt;/code>).
Besides, the packages installed by the package managers are often too old to
have the latest features. Or, even if we have root priviledge, we do not want
to mess up with the system-wide packages and just want to experiment with a
package locally. On these ocassions, we may want to install the package to a
custom location.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Compile and Install Latest Version of GCC on CentOS 7</title><link>https://jdhao.github.io/2017/09/04/install-gcc-newer-version-on-centos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2017 22:41:10 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://jdhao.github.io/2017/09/04/install-gcc-newer-version-on-centos/</guid><description>&lt;p>The default GCC that comes with the CentOS 7.2 is GCC 4.8.5, which does not
support the complete C++11 standard, for example, it does not fully support
&lt;a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex">regular expressions&lt;/a>. In order to use
regular expression functions, &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8061172/6064933">we need to install at least GCC
4.9.0&lt;/a>. The following installation
procedure is applicable to CentOS 7 and are not tested on other Linux systems.
Also you have to make sure that you have root privelege.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
